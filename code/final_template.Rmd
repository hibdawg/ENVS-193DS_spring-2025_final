# Problem 1. Research Writing

## a. 
[In part one they used a correlation test to determine how two variables, distance from headwater (km) and annual total nitrogen load (kg year^-1) relate or are associated with eachother. My coworker also use an ANOVA in part 2 to compare the means of more than two groups.]

## b.
[Accepting uncertainty is key in interpreting analysis of variance, and can be conducted through communicating the confidence intervals, such as the CI of the difference between urban land, atmospheric desposition, fertilizer, wastewater treatment, and grasslands.Tukey's Honestly Signifiant difference can be used to further investigate which groups are diffent when compares, giving information on pairwise comparison, difference in means between groups, and adjusted p-value to increase transparency.Effect size can also be used to determine how strongly distance from headwater (KM) effects the annual total nitrogen load (kg year^-1) found between groups.]

 
## c. 
[We found a neglible difference (n^2= effect size) between groups in mean nitrogen load (One-Way Anova, F-distribution(among groups Degrees of Freedom,within group Degrees of Freedom) = f-value, p < 0.02, $\alpha$ = signifcance level)

On average, there was little difference of nitrogen load between urban land, atmospheric deposition, fertilizer, wastewater treatment and grasslands (Tukey HSD difference, % Confidence Interval:[CI, CI](kg year^-1) based on distance from headwater (KM)) ]

# Problem 3: Data Analysis 

## a. 
[The ones in this dataset represent an prescence of bird within each column, meaning prescence of swift parrot, common starling, unoccupied, or tree martin within each categorical column for each species. The 0s indicate that the box for each category is other species, empty, or occupied.]

## b. 
[Swift parrots are nomadic, critically endangered due to deforestation and predation, and rarely breed in the same location. The selective nature of swift parrots is different from common starlings and Tree Martins, which are generalists and can easily compete with swift parrots for nest boxes.]

## c. 
[The two years the authors looked at were 2016 and 2019 during breeding times for swift parrots stimulated by mast tree flowering event. Swift parrots are not known to occupy repeat breeding sites, so the second season tests how permanent next boxes are utilized by swift parrots and non-target species.]
